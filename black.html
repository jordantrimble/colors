<h2>positive associations</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">we think of black as sophisticated and serious. it's the preferred color for much formal attire, and the little black dress is a classic piece of attire that's timeless and always appropriate. black is unambiguous, definite. it's not easily misunderstood, and in design it's dramatic and helps create a feeling of certainty.</p>
<h3>negative associantions</h3>
<p>black's somber hue is associated with mourning in much of the world. a black mark on your record reveals wrongdoing, and we characterize bed people as being black-hearted. black is frightening, as it conceals, rather than illuminates, and the cover of night is a perfect scenario for bad behavior. too much black in design can be overwhelming and dull.</p>

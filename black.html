<h2>positive associations</h2>
<p style="text-align:center>we think of black as sophisticated and serious. it's the preferred color for much formal attire, and the little black dress is a classic piece of attire thats timeless and always appropriate. black is umbiguous, definite. it's not easily misunderstood, and in design it's dramatic and helps create a feeling of certinty.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="p2">Since red is the color of blood, it has historically been associated with sacrifice, danger, and courage. Modern surveys in Europe and the United States show red is also the color most commonly associated with heat, activity, passion, sexuality, anger, love, and joy.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;" class="p3">How it relates to love</h3>
    <p style="text-align: left;" class="p3">Far more than a cautionary signal, red is also synonymous with passion. When love is in the air, so too is the color red. Used to evoke feelings of lust and desire, this ruby hue entices with its seduction. When worn on the lips, it becomes even more appealing and eye-catching. To strike a balance between sexy and feminine, red never misses the mark.
